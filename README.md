## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Used HTML and the DOM in JavaScript. With API and async, await functionality , I am pulling the evolutions in order of appearance. 


## Lessons Learned:

Am working on producing conditional statements for those pokemon with more than 3 evolutions

## Optimization:
remove old evolutions
create logic to allow 1,2,3+ evolutions to show
Insert html-moves using Javascript
